A gamified iOS application based on the popular and effective Pomodoro technique created using FlutterDart+XCode on AndroidStudio along with GoogleAuth, AppleAuth, and Firebase implementation.
------------------------------------------
Concept:
To gamify the Pomodoro focus technique in a competitive gamification method through competition and leaderboard ranking system based on points earned through focus minute count and a reward-based gamification through earning virtual money and earning badges.

In summary, the code does the following:
- Uses GoogleAuth to use Google Sign-In features
- Uses AppleAuth to use Apple Sign-In features
- Firebase registers all signed in users
- Has a homepage to show the user profile (name, points) along with a sign out option and a delete account option
- Can use the feature to use the normal Pomodoro timer with strict mode as well (unable to pause timer if in strict mode) in the home page
- Has a store page that displays the timer that can be used to earn virtual money and the store section from where badges can be purchased, equipped, or unequipped
- Has a page to show all active users and options to send a timer request for a challenge to any online user
- Has a leaderboard page that ranks users based on points
- Has a real-time challenging feature that allows two users to use the Pomodoro timer in real-time (everything is updated in Firebase accordingly)
